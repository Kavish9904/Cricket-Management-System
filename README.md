# Cricket Management System

This repository contains SQL scripts for creating a Cricket Management System (CMS) database. The system manages data related to cricket players, teams, matches, and scores.

## Database Structure

The CMS consists of the following tables:

- **Players**: Stores player details like ID, name, age, and team affiliation.
- **Teams**: Stores team information such as ID, name, coach, and home ground.
- **Matches**: Stores details about matches between teams, including match date, location, and winner.
- **Scores**: Stores player performance in matches, including runs scored, wickets taken, and overs bowled.

## SQL Scripts

The SQL script sets up the database schema and populates it with sample data for players, teams, matches, and scores. It also includes queries to retrieve data from each table.
